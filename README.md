# APM466(Math Theory in Finance) A1 by Jincheng Leng

## Aims
Given data for 32 Canadian Government bonds, we have to choose 10 bonds to construct a “0-5 year” yield,spot and forward curves using some techniques such as bootstrapping.

## Coding Logic
Since Each type of bond has many characteristics which we would like to keep track of, using objected oriented programming may be a good choice. I constucted a class and consider each bond as an object to keep track of their information. Another approach is to store those information in a dataframe using pandas or simply using Python Dictionary.

## Files
"Mathfin A1 Jincheng.ipynb" includes all codes for my assignment  
"full_data.csv" includes data of all 32 bonds  
"bond_price" and "bond_price2" includes information of bonds that I used for my assignment
